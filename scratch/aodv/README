recvreply sends to next hop with scoket->sendTo
sendPacketFromQueeu sends the data packet (I think_)

in recvrequest, right before calling sendreply, increment rrep_sent. 
right before calling SendReplyByIntermediateNode, this is a forwarding.
This is where the rrep is sent.

Not su

dst is the the destination where the data packet should go.

rrepheader: sets a dst ==rreqHeader.GetDst()

rrep_received nicrements when a node receives an rrep that has itself
as the origin.
