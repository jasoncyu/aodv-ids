This is a simulation for wireless sensor networks using the AODV protocol.
The approach used is basically the one used by this paper:
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15501320600692044

ns-3.13

The only files in this repository are those I wrote myself or ns-3
core files that I modified. This repository should be put in wherever
you install ns-3.

Majority of simulation files are in scratch/aodv
